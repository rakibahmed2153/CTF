A message broadcasted about some instruction of a secret group. Unfortunately, the message was encrypted. Can you try to decrypt the message?{HVXIVG}
Think you got the things which are totally opposite what you want.

The format of this flag is CYBERDRILL{flag}

Ans:

After watching the cipher I thought it was a Caesar cipher because it’s only text so if shifting the text might get the flag. But I was wrong I tried but didn’t get the flag. Then I tried Alphabetical substitution its also like Caesar cipher and I successfully got the flag.

We detect one password protected web based backdoor shell in one of our Linux server. Can you help us for find out the related login password for this backdoor ?

The format of this flag is DRILL2020{flag}

Ans:

After downloading the file I found that it’s a PHP shell. In this shell, the hacker used a backdoor code to bypass the login and can have access to the site. We used a password to log in to a site and that password is stored in a database but in the code, the hacker used a written password that the password didn’t get from the database hacker can easily use that password and log in to the site without having it the id and password. He created the backdoor. so in the file, you can easily see the code written password. And In the test same code was written multiple times to create confusion.

The format of this flag is CYBERDRILL{flag}

Ans:

A hint was given that star war. After that, I search on google war cipher and I got a cipher name that was Enigma machine cipher.



Then I Go to cryptii website and found that an Enigma machine and its some functions are matched with the question formate.



So I have matched the format and got a plain text need to do some modification on it to make it readable and that was the flag.
